- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thelk22, or Luke for anyone who knows me! 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quite a lot...
- ðŸ‘€ The crossover between maths and technology is what I'm best at, and having worked as an engineer I like to apply solid design principles in my work. 
- :soccer: I'm also a big sports fan, and I love a bit of history too.
- ðŸ‘€ I have plenty more interests, which you'll find out if you get to know me!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying the [Fintech with Data Science MSc](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2021/eng/msc-financial-technology-with-data-science/) at Bristol University.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on here or via email at either of the following addresses: luke.kirwan22@gmail.com, luke.kirwan@bath.edu
